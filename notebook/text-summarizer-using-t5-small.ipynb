    "Text Summarizer using T5-small model 📝\n",
    "===\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1- Overview\n",
    "In this project, we explored transformer-based models for text summarization. We specifically utilized the T5-Small model to summarize news articles. The T5-Small model was chosen due to its lightweight architecture, which makes it suitable for shorter texts and environments with limited computational resources. To optimize performance, we sampled the dataset to align with the available computational power.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2- Dataset Used\n",
    "We used a news dataset containing two main columns:\n",
    "- Text – the full body of the news article.\n",
    "- Headline – the target summary representing the expected output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3- Data Cleaning\n",
    "The dataset underwent several cleaning steps to ensure quality and consistency:\n",
    "- Removed duplicate records.\n",
    "- Eliminated URLs, special characters, and extra whitespaces from the text.\n",
    "- Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to enhance performance evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4- Data Preprocessing\n",
    "We tokenized the text data into numerical representations that the T5 model can process effectively. This step ensures that both input texts and target summaries are appropriately encoded before training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5- Modeling\n",
    "We implemented and fine-tuned the T5-Small model using the following approach:\n",
    "- Defined the model architecture and training parameters.\n",
    "- Chose ROUGE as the evaluation metric to assess summarization quality.\n",
    "- Trained the model for 3 epochs, monitoring training and validation performance."
